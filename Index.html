      <li>
        <strong>Use the Dedicated Support Number:</strong> Call <span class="phone">+1-888 (829) 1117</span> or <span class="phone">1-800-EXPEDIA</span> to reach the Expedia support center directly in the U.S. Available 24 hours a day.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Have Your Booking Details Ready:</strong> Before calling, keep your itinerary number, email, and traveler name handy. This speeds up verification and resolution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Try the Live Chat Feature First:</strong> Navigate to the “Help” section on Expedia.com and click “Chat Now” to speak with an agent instantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use the Expedia App for Faster Support:</strong> Within the Expedia mobile app, you can access live chat, submit support requests, or call customer service with one tap.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use “Call Back” Requests When Offered:</strong> If you don’t want to stay on hold, choose the “Call Me Back” option from the phone queue or help center.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contact During Non-Peak Hours:</strong> Early mornings (before 9 AM) or late evenings (after 8 PM) tend to have shorter wait times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Be Clear and Concise:</strong> Explain your issue briefly and clearly to help the agent assist you more effectively. Avoid going off-topic during the call.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ask for a Supervisor When Needed:</strong> If the front-line agent cannot resolve your issue, respectfully request to speak with a supervisor or escalation team.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use Social Media as a Backup:</strong> Send a direct message to Expedia on Twitter/X or Facebook for urgent attention, especially if you’re not getting responses via phone.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Keep Track of Support Tickets:</strong> Always ask for a case ID or email confirmation for reference. This helps if you need to follow up later.
